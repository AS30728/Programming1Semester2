Narrator: The user travels to the St. Petersburg residence of Sergei Barchev.  Inside is a sprawling estate with 40 rooms and 52 bathrooms.  The pathway is outlined in gold bars and Barchev doesn’t appear to be hiding his wealth.  When the user raps on the door, Barchev himself answers, welcoming the user.
Barchev: It was a real shame that Dmitry got blown up.  He was my close friend and saved my life in Afghanistan.  I was eternally grateful to him.  If there is anything I can do to help find the murderers, please tell me and I will gracioulsly do so.
User: Why were you in the Hotel Metropol on Sunday?
Barchev: I was going to give a campaign donation myself to Dmitry, but he wasn’t there like he told me.
User: Where did you get your wealth from? Don’t give me the “through hard work” bs, I want facts.
Barchev: I had gotten contracts from Dmitry to manufacture guns and tanks for the Russian Army.  There was a handsome bonus for the contractor and I managed to become one.  Because of this, I owe my fortune to Dmitry.  Please don’t tell the KGB or whoever is in charge anymore about this, they will likely kill me.
User: Don’t worry, your secret is safe with me.  Tell me, what do you know about Zhukov and his dealings with ISreal, you seem to know much about the Russian Army and corruption.
Barchev: I shouldn’t be telling you this but Zhukov is a traitor to Russia.  Not only does he fund our allies but he also funded Israel and told them about the plan of Dmitry to overthrow their government.  He has also been funding them on many of their anti-Russian jobs they have to complete.  
User: How do you know all this?
Barchev: I used to support Zhukov and we used to be really good friends, or so I thought.  One day, he literally threw me under a bus after I said that I would give him ten-billion ruble in my will and when I survived, he tried to put a cap in me but I dodged and survived.  Ever since then, I am only glad to do anything against him.
User: What about anything between the CIA and Mossad?
Barchev: My source in the CIA told me that Mossad and the CIA were working on something big.  They had received funding from a third party numbered Swiss bank account and they got two men in Russia.  Though I don’t know what this something is, I sure as h*** know it isn’t good.
User: Thank you for that, what about corruption in the GRU?
Barchev: Which one, there are at least 100 I know about?
User: Anything related to Dmitry.
Barchev: I know that one man they had in the GRU who protected Dmitry and was blown up in the explosion had bad habits of womanizing and drinking.  Rumors have it that he was approached by Mossad sometime but there is no evidence of that.  
User: Thank you.
