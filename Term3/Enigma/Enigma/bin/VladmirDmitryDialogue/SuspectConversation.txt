Narrator: The user called a meeting of representatives from Israel and Mossad; the father of Ivana Ivanovich, the first wife of Dmitry; a representative from the _____, the only true democratic branch of Russia, but doesn’t have much power; Major General Zhukov; and the CIA Director, Frank Gates.  Without the guests knowing it, their phones are being hacked by Devin Mitnick as they are talking to the user.
User: Well, by now we must all know that Dmitry has been blown up at the Hotel Metropol in Murmansk, and we are trying to find out who did it.  Let me cut the rhetoric and be quite frank with you guys, what did any of you have against Dmitry?
Zhukov: He had served with me in Afghanistan when the USSR invaded.  While fighting, a grenade landed in his bunk and he threw it over into the front lines where it almost blew me up and took off the leg of my comrade.  Then when he was running for politics, he brought up my love affairs to prevent me from getting the nomination and publicly humiliated me.  He never apologized, and the cash given to the military never came to me.  Though none of this is enough for me to blow him up, nor do I have the resources to do so. 
Israel/Mossad representative, Ben Allon: He funded the terrorists who want our destruction, he attempted to overthrow our government with Russian soldiers, and he threatened to launch an ICMB at Tel Aviv, of course we hate him, though we did not blow him up.
Ivanovich: My daughter was killed by assassins in her sleep and the week after her murder, Dmitry re-married.  I personally see a coincidence and hate the man for killing my daughter.  I did not, however, blow him up because I don’t have the funds to do so.
Vasilly (people’s representative): He has failed to represent the people as president.  He is illegitimately elected every year and elections are rigged.  He keeps raising taxes to put in his pockets.  He doesn’t even come close to being the auspicious leader he depicts himself to be.  We as the people who aren’t benefited by his rule don’t personally like him.  
Gates: We are the CIA, we don’t like anyone outside the US, even then, we hate half the US Congressmen and many times the president.  We especially don’t like Russia and we dislike its leaders, but we had nothing personal against Dmitry and were sorry for his untimely death as we actually liked him as President. 
User: (over pager to Mitnick) How much longer do you need to hack into the systems?
Mitnick: Give me half-an-hour.
User: None of these guys are giving anything, maybe you can find something in their secret files.
Mitnick: I’ll let you know if I find anything useful.
User: I will distract them for another hour. 
One hour later
User: Thank you for meeting here, I appreciate you coming here to talk to me about this very pressing matter.  
(to Mitnick) How did the hacking go?
Mitnick: Nothing in inbox but in secure delete, there were some pretty bad files that may be of some use to you.
User: I’ll be there as soon as possible.
At the Kremlin
User: What did you find?
Mitnick: Apparently, the only one telling the truth was Ivanovich and Vasilly.  Ivanovich truly is in hard times as he is no longer receiving funds from his daughter and his bank accounts are almost drained.  He needed cash badly and resorted to begging, so I placed a billion ruble of money the KGB stole in 1982 into his bank account with a message to use it wisely.  Vasilly and the people didn’t have any funding that could have been sent to an international terrorist organization or to enemies of Russia.  Without this funding, they couldn’t have funded the terrorists who blew up Dmitry.  However, there was something interesting with Gates, Zhukov, and Allon.  From the looks of Mossad secret files, Allon was an assassin in Operation Wrath of God and one of the men on the list was the father of Dmitry, he and Dmitry never got along.  When he was promoted to head of Mossad, he wrote in his journal entry that he would swear to get revenge on every enemy of Israel.  Zhukov didn’t avoid skimming the army budget like he said that he did, he just did it legally by raising his salary and people didn’t notice one of the highest paid officials in Russia getting a higher salary.  He had been funding many anti-Russia organizations as well as the radical-Islamic groups of ISIS and the Taliban.  He has a majority of his wealth sitting in un-traceable numbered Swiss bank accounts.  We have some funds that are going to Israel and Mossad through fake stock in Israeli companies.  He could very well have funded the terrorists, but he doesn’t have the people or the ability to commit this crime himself.  And finally, Gates is a lying American “patriot”.  He had worked for the CIA since college graduation and he is in his late 50s.  America has too many reasons to dislike Dmitry, like 1990 when Russia supplied the enemies of America AK47s as well as T-54 tanks to fight them.  Then since 2010, they have supported the Islamic radical groups with tanks and planes as well as bombing American allies in the middle-east for the last 3 years.  I managed to find a list of the American spies and I can send this to our friends at the Kremlin if you want.  
User: Thanks, I shall take this into consideration.
